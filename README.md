C LANGUAGE PRACTICE PORTFOLIO

This repository is a detailed collection of my C programming work, created during my first semester and early stages of learning programming.
It documents my progress from basic syntax to more advanced concepts through consistent hands-on practice.

The goal of this repository is to learn by doing, strengthen problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in C programming.

SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

• Logical thinking and problem solving
• Structured programming approach
• Use of functions and modular code
• Array manipulation and matrix operations
• File handling for data storage and retrieval
• Pointer usage and memory concepts
• Recursion and iterative solutions
• Basic debugging and error handling
• Working with real-world style problems

PROGRAM CATEGORIES

• Basic syntax and input/output programs
• Conditional logic (if-else, switch cases)
• Loop-based programs (for, while, do-while)
• One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
• String handling programs
• Mathematical and pattern-based problems
• File handling (read, write, append, copy)
• Structure-based programs (students, bank, shop, employees, etc.)
• Mini projects and quizzes

FOLDER STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

arrays → Array and matrix programs
functions → Function-based and recursion programs
filehandling → File input/output practice
structures → Structure-based programs
root directory → Individual experiments and practice tasks

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By working on these programs, I have learned to:

• Break problems into smaller steps
• Write readable and structured code
• Apply programming concepts to real scenarios
• Debug common runtime and logical errors
• Understand how memory and data flow work in C
• Gain confidence in writing programs from scratch

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES

Programming Language : C (primary), C++ (secondary)
Compiler : GCC, Dev-C++
Operating System : Windows
Version Control : Git & GitHub

PROJECT STATUS

This repository is actively evolving.
Code quality, structure, and organization will continue to improve as my learning progresses.

Some compiled and IDE-generated files (.exe, .dev, .layout) are present from early practice stages.
These will be cleaned and excluded in future updates.

PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS

• Cleaner directory structure
• Removal of compiled binaries
• Addition of comments and documentation
• Better naming conventions
• More structured mini projects
• Use of Makefiles and proper builds

WHY THIS REPOSITORY MATTERS

This repository reflects consistency, discipline, and growth rather than perfection.
It serves as a transparent record of my programming journey and learning mindset.
